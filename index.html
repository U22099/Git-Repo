                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p> I'm a self-taught Front End Developer and Graphics Designer from Nigeria.
                    I have started my website development career since when I was 14 years old and
                    I am an expertise in Simple Static Web Development, Graphics Designing, Python
                    -HTML-CSS and JAVASCRIPT programming language. I strongly emphasis the need for cross
                    platform support in all my web project, making sure to incorporate mobile support in all
                    website that I have created. I enjoy creating responsive website with a focus on 
                    design, accessibility and pleasing user interface.
                    I aspire to become a full stack developer and create my personal
                    social media application.
