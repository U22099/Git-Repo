                <p>I have started my website development career since when I was 14 years old and

                    -HTML-CSS and JAVASCRIPT programming language. I strongly emphasis the need for cross
                    platform support in all my web project, making sure to incorporate mobile support in all
                    website that I have created. I aspire to become a full stack developer and create my personal
